Why Does This Script Exist?
----------

- Heroku Doesn't Provide Users Enough Dynos Under Their Free Quota For An App To Last An Entire Month Without Sleeping. And Not Everyone Has A Credit-Card. Even Worse. Heroku Refuses To Accept My Credit-Cards From Legit Banks, Even Though They Have International Payments Enabled. I'm Left With No Choice ;-;
- I Also Have Some Strange Deep Affection Towards Heroku.....um..yea, I'm Weird.

## **Warnings:**
- This Bot/Script Uses GitHub Actions, Although Running One Lightweight Action Once In Thirteen Days, Is In No Way Considered Abuse Of It. You Are Still Warned Of Account Suspension(If You Reduce The Cron-Job Frequency)(If You Already Have A Billion Other Consecutive GitHub Actions Running[Although GitHub Allows Only 20 Concurrent Jobs Per Account])
- You Better Have A Backup Of Your App-Data/Configs As Heroku Can Ban Your Account Whenever They Please.
